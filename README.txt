This is a repository to house primarily Arduino code for 
ISU's Electrical Subsystem.

At the moment, it contains code for a telemetry system, but will 
likely include 3D models and other resources soon. 

We do not own the Telemetry viewer software, we simply have it here 
for ease of access. All rights belong to the owner (Farrell, http://www.farrellf.com).
